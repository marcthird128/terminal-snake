# Terminal Snake

A terminal based snake game using node.js

## Run

Download the `snake.js` file in this repository, open a terminal emulator
or TTY, navigate to the directory the js file is in, and type `node snake.js`.
If it gives you an error, type `apt install nodejs` first and try again.
If that doesn't work, [download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and
try again. If that doesn't work, then idk whats wrong.

## Contribute

Currently the code is so simple its all in one unminified file.
If you want you can organize it better and add webpack and stuff.
