# Terminal Snake

A terminal based snake game using node.js

## Run

Download the `snake.js` file in this repository, open a terminal emulator
or TTY, navigate to the directory the js file is in, and type `node snake.js`.
If it gives you an error, type `apt install nodejs` first and try again.
If that doesn't work, [download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and
try again. If that doesn't work, then idk whats wrong.

## Contribute

The current code is intentionally simple and contained within a single, 
unminified file. If you're interested in contributing, here are some ideas for improvement:

* **Code Organization:** You could refactor the code into separate modules or use classes to better organize the game logic, rendering functions, and input handling.
* **Build Process:** Adding a build tool like Webpack could allow for more complex asset management or code transformations in the future (though it might be overkill for this simple project right now).
* **New Features:** Feel free to suggest and implement new gameplay elements, visual enhancements, or difficulty settings!

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your improvements.
